this is a character search engine for one of my favorite shows Rick & Mortyâ„¢. ive learned a few new things creating this and solidified knowledge that ive recently gained. 


(the page that has all the specific characters info when you click on their card, i called it "character details" so thats what i mean when i say that. i couldnt think of a better name)



  //  WHAT I LEARNED

-i made a mouse tracker, onMouseMove thingy. never seen one like that. its also ricks carship from the show and i made it so theres 5 so it looks like its going super fast through space

-sometimes you have to reorganize the entire page for different screen widths. i somewhat knew this but the "character details" really showed me. such weird shapes to deal with, it re-arranges maybe 3 times total and that was a pain but im a people pleaser, and user experience is a part of that.

   // ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

-the back button on the "character details" page. i tried to make it look like a guy falling into a portal but its not super pretty. im gonna change it so the portal appears behind him and he shrinks and opacity fades to 0. but itll do for now.

-when you go back to the character list page. from the "character details" page. it doesnt save the page youre on

   // INTERESTING THINGS SOME MAY NOT NOTICE
   
    / home page
   
  -mouse tracker. i had to add a vertical offset because the mouse was over the image
  
  -the news looking bar. it was supposed to look like those bars you see at the bottom of the screen on the news like "florida man gets aligator pregnant" and it was supposed to have stuff like that. but i put that rant that was at the end of one of the episodes where he was like "rick and morty forever morty, 100 years of rick and morty just me and you..." i thought that was hi-fricking-larious

  -the search button. it looks like hes running to the portal

  -the news bar was also to seperate the different space images. theyre different patterns of stars, im just swaggy like that o3o
  
    / character list page

  -the cards have some details on them so you know which version your looking at. thers alot of clones and alternate universes it gets confusing

  -functional filter, page selector, search bar, and skeleton loading state
   
    / character detail page

  -theres a dark mode, a sick one at that

  - if youre on a dead characters info page and you hover over their image it will say "dead" in this big red bar

  - if its in the dark mode. and you hover over the boxes with text the box shadow goes from a sci-fi green to a electric blue

  - the back button looks like a guy falling into a portal, and the portal appears when you hover over it.
